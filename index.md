# Karthikeya Lakoji's First CS193 Homework

Some of my favorite things about CS193:

```
- The TAs are awesome and friendly!
- The class is a **great** opportunity to meet new people!
- I _love_ learning about command line commands!
- That's about it for now.
```
Thanks a lot for taking the time to learn more about why I love CS193.
